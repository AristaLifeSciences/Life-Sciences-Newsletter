The airwaves are continuously saturated with everything from neighboring rogue Wi-Fi networks to microwaves in the break room heating your co-workers' lunch. The last thing we want to interrupt are the valuable radio cycles dedicated to any given user device. In order to adapt to a real time RF environment, access points have historically consumed bits of those client cycles to successfully channel plan, power plan, and avoid inevitable interference. </p> <p>But what if we didn\u2019t have to live in that world any longer?</p> <p>I\u2019d like to take a moment to highlight the Multifunction Radio present in many of Arista Networks access points. A dedicated Tri-Band radio that is capable of giving those client radio cycles back to the clients! A true swiss army knife of the wireless world. Not only does this radio take over the burden of traditional client radio background scanning, it offers a breadth of tools to add to your engineers toolbelt. A few of my favorites include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The ability to turn this radio into a client! Gain real time network insights for a specific location and simulate day-to-day traffic activities. These include simple throughput testing, VoIP calling tests, or even simulating reachability to your custom applications. Run these tests against neighboring APs before ever stepping foot onsite.</p> </li> <li> <p>Always available Spectrum Analysis - Stop spending your wi-fi budget on additional standalone spectrum sensors!</p> </li> <li> <p>Over-The-Air Packet Captures - Get a deeper analysis of your environment by capturing Management, Data and Control Frames from an AP and surrounding APs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These are all very useful tools to support an ever-changing wireless environment.</p> <p>  Arista Multifunction Radio Uses </p> <p>Give your Wi-Fi a break and consider adding the Arista Multifunction Radio to your fleet.

That has held true for my 9 year tenure. </p> <p>When people are exposed to Arista, light bulbs go off, they evaluate our technology, then they purchase it - every time.  And they never stop thanking us for helping to make their lives easier. They don\u2019t have to chase as many outages from bugs. They don\u2019t have to create downtime to fix security vulnerabilities. They have their nights, weekends and holidays back and can spend more time doing the things they love.</p> <p>I cannot think of a single reason to work with legacy network providers.  Arista already has everything that everyone is searching for in a modern network infrastructure.</p> <ul> <li>Five nines reliability (99.999% uptime) </li> <li>Hitless upgrades</li> <li>Network-wide automation</li> <li>Real-time streaming telemetry</li> <li>Seamless and massive scalability</li> <li>Holistic security</li> <li>Simplicity</li> <li>etc. </li> </ul> <p>all built on open-standards protocols. </p> <p>No proprietary lock-in.</p> <p>And the best thing - the thing that application developers, operations managers and network engineers alike LOVE THE MOST - is a completely UNIFIED OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.  </p> <p>Yes - ONE operating system and ONE management platform across all previous network \u201csilos\u201d: LAN, WAN, MAN, DC, Campus, Switching, Routing, Cloud, etc.  </p> <p>We can\u2019t imagine how organizations have been running on such fragmented silos - each with their own OS; each with their own management tools; each with their own unique set of bugs and security holes. How can your business nimbly capture new markets - with first mover advantage - when you\u2019re constantly engaged in fixing the plethora of disparate systems you already have?</p> <p>With varying, fragmented silos, how can you have a unified automation strategy?  How can you uniformly apply Zero Trust Policies? How long does it take to certify new applications or app changes across an abundance of operating systems? Think of how long it takes to patch security holes in every binary of your infrastructure. And then all the licensing - don\u2019t get me started\u2026</p> <p>Those that have joined the Arista family tell us how much less grunt-work they do. The #1 compliment we receive is \u201cYour systems just work\u201d.  How nice. </p> <p>The network SHOULD just work so that YOU can do REAL work for the company. </p> <p>Again, I say that Arista already has everything everyone is looking for - without the headaches. It was built from the ground up to unify all the traditional silos with a stunning history of quality, reliability and stability.</p> <p>Now, Arista is not perfect. This is software, after all. Software is a human endeavor and humans are not yet perfect. And even now, with the advent of AI-generated software, one cannot test EVERY possible situation. YOUR network is unique - it\u2019s going to present anomalies to every new technology. </p> <p>And here\u2019s Arista\u2019s critical advantage: it has a Technical Assistance Center (TAC) staffed only by Level 3 engineers. No escalations, no complex VRUs to get through before you speak to a Level 1 engineer who asks questions that insult your intelligence, then a Level 2 engineer who doesn\u2019t understand your problem; then a \u201cduty manager\u201d (always makes me laugh - thank you Chandler Bing), THEN finally (maybe) a smarty.  </p> <p>Arista TAC: 30 seconds to get to an Arista-badged, Level 3 engineer.  No entitlement questions asked.  Problem solved.</p> <p>Our clients LOVE THIS.  We know because they tell us.</p> <p>When I joined Arista our revenue was just shy of $1B. I wondered to myself \u201cA Level 3-only TAC is well and good for a small &lt;$1B company, but how will that scale?\u201d  But here we are now - 8 times the size of when I started, and we still have a +87 NPS Score TAC that answers your call in under 30 seconds with A LEVEL-3 ENGINEER WHO WILL SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM.</p> <p>The reason we\u2019ve been able to hold on to that model is because of the quality of our code. </p> <p>When you get quality right, you get everything right.</p> <p>This cannot be understated. </p> <p>As a result, Arista has orders of magnitude fewer regression bugs and security vulnerabilities than the competition.</p> <p>Fewer bugs &amp; CVEs means fewer critical support calls.</p> <p>Fewer TAC calls means you can staff it with the best smarties - without bankrupting the company.</p> <p>In Upstate NY, we\u2019ve installed over 5,000 switches and routers across a 12-13 year period. Not one serious network outage. I\u2019ve not been on a single P1 (network down) crisis call; not one P2 (network severely degraded) call. I\u2019ve not had to work nights, weekends or holidays because OUR CLIENTS have not had to work nights, weekends or holidays.</p> <p>No other network vendor has all of these qualities. This is how and why we\u2019ve grown to a nearly $10B company - not by slick marketing and deceptive advertising, but BY WORD OF MOUTH. </p> <p>And that word of mouth is: \u201cArista just works\u201d.</p> <p>So again I say: our greatest competition is people not knowing about us. </p> <p>Help us spread the word. </p>"},{"location":"#feel-free-to-reach-out-to-us-for-your-network-needs","title":"Feel Free to Reach Out To Us For Your Network Needs","text":"<p>We thank you for taking the time to read our newsletter today.

One of those late-night runs when the crowds are gone and the shelves are half empty. Passing the bakery, I saw it: one lonely, forgotten cupcake sitting on a tray like it had missed the party.</p> <p>Then I noticed a rainbow of balloons swaying under the AC vents and had a sudden sinking feeling.

It was built on open standards and designed to scale. What is more impressive is how it has grown. Over the past decade, CloudVision has added live streaming telemetry, workflow automation, network auditability and compliance, campus-focused features, multi-domain security, AI-driven analytics, and much more.

But some of our most meaningful success stories are unfolding much closer to home. One such example is in the Town of Webster, New York, where local government leaders turned to Arista to modernize their critical network infrastructure.</p> <p>This month, we spoke with Steve Peace, Director of Information Technology, and John Camille, Network Administrator for the Town of Webster, to learn how Arista is reshaping their operations from the ground up. \u201cEye-opening. That\u2019s the short version,\u201d said Camille. \u201cThe longer version? Arista has completely changed how we think about and manage our network.\u201d</p> <p>Like many municipalities, Webster\u2019s network had developed organically over time, with a patchwork of vendors and gear. That led to complexity, inconsistent configurations, and a reliance on workarounds instead of streamlined solutions. According to Camille, the change since deploying Arista has been dramatic. \u201cNow, we can rack and configure a switch on-site and push configurations through CloudVision. What used to take days now takes hours.\u201d</p> <p>CloudVision, Arista\u2019s management and analytics platform, has also revolutionized how Webster troubleshoots and plans their network. \u201cThe level of visibility and insight into client experience and network health is unmatched. We can show exactly where things are working and where they\u2019re not. No guesswork, just facts.\u201d</p> <p>Camille highlighted the daily tools that have become essential to his team\u2019s operations: dashboards, topology mapping, CVE and bug visibility, MAC address history, health monitoring, and configlet management\u2014all within CloudVision. \u201cChange management used to mean reading twenty pages of documentation, digging through forum threads, and deciphering handwritten notes,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s one platform, one book, one design. It just works. Working with Arista makes everything easier\u2014management, planning, implementation, and yes, even budgeting.\u201d</p> <p>From a leadership standpoint, the Town of Webster had clear goals: simplify network management, improve performance, and strengthen security. For Steve Peace, cost savings and long-term sustainability were critical factors in evaluating a new vendor. \u201cWe wanted to improve manageability, increase performance, eliminate vendor creep, and enhance our security posture by being able to easily install updates and fixes,\u201d Peace explained. \u201cWe also needed a solution with the fewest CVEs in the market and at a lower cost. Arista checked every box.\u201d</p> <p>According to Peace, the decision to go with Arista didn\u2019t take long. \u201cThe features, simplified licensing, and lower cost made it an easy decision. All switches operate on the same firmware, which makes updates and programming much easier.\u201d Results came quickly. Security posture improved with modern hardware. CloudVision provided end-to-end visibility and control across every location.
