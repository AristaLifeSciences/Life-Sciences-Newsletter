One of those late-night runs when the crowds are gone and the shelves are half empty.

More than just a management interface, it has become the foundation of operational simplicity and visibility across Arista deployments.</p> <p>When CloudVision launched in 2015, it offered a single point of visibility for the entire network fabric. It was built on open standards and designed to scale. What is more impressive is how it has grown. Over the past decade, CloudVision has added live streaming telemetry, workflow automation, network auditability and compliance, campus-focused features, multi-domain security, AI-driven analytics, and much more.

But some of our most meaningful success stories are unfolding much closer to home. One such example is in the Town of Webster, New York, where local government leaders turned to Arista to modernize their critical network infrastructure.</p> <p>This month, we spoke with Steve Peace, Director of Information Technology, and John Camille, Network Administrator for the Town of Webster, to learn how Arista is reshaping their operations from the ground up. \u201cEye-opening. That\u2019s the short version,\u201d said Camille. \u201cThe longer version? Arista has completely changed how we think about and manage our network.\u201d</p> <p>Like many municipalities, Webster\u2019s network had developed organically over time, with a patchwork of vendors and gear. That led to complexity, inconsistent configurations, and a reliance on workarounds instead of streamlined solutions. According to Camille, the change since deploying Arista has been dramatic. \u201cNow, we can rack and configure a switch on-site and push configurations through CloudVision. What used to take days now takes hours.\u201d</p> <p>CloudVision, Arista\u2019s management and analytics platform, has also revolutionized how Webster troubleshoots and plans their network. \u201cThe level of visibility and insight into client experience and network health is unmatched. We can show exactly where things are working and where they\u2019re not. No guesswork, just facts.\u201d</p> <p>Camille highlighted the daily tools that have become essential to his team\u2019s operations: dashboards, topology mapping, CVE and bug visibility, MAC address history, health monitoring, and configlet management\u2014all within CloudVision. \u201cChange management used to mean reading twenty pages of documentation, digging through forum threads, and deciphering handwritten notes,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s one platform, one book, one design. It just works. Working with Arista makes everything easier\u2014management, planning, implementation, and yes, even budgeting.\u201d</p> <p>From a leadership standpoint, the Town of Webster had clear goals: simplify network management, improve performance, and strengthen security. For Steve Peace, cost savings and long-term sustainability were critical factors in evaluating a new vendor. \u201cWe wanted to improve manageability, increase performance, eliminate vendor creep, and enhance our security posture by being able to easily install updates and fixes,\u201d Peace explained. \u201cWe also needed a solution with the fewest CVEs in the market and at a lower cost. Arista checked every box.\u201d</p> <p>According to Peace, the decision to go with Arista didn\u2019t take long. \u201cThe features, simplified licensing, and lower cost made it an easy decision. All switches operate on the same firmware, which makes updates and programming much easier.\u201d Results came quickly. Security posture improved with modern hardware. CloudVision provided end-to-end visibility and control across every location. Configuration changes and software updates now roll out with speed and minimal disruption. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very pleased with the devices and products installed so far,\u201d Peace said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the improvements once all our facilities are migrated to Arista.\u201d</p> <p>The Town of Webster\u2019s journey reflects a growing trend across Upstate New York. Towns, counties, and public agencies are choosing Arista to simplify their networks, bolster security, and gain the agility to support evolving community needs. Whether managing large-scale cloud infrastructure or securing essential services for a local government, Arista delivers the same standard of reliability, visibility, and innovation.</p> <p>What sets Arista apart?</p> <ul> <li>A single operating system across campus, data center, WAN, and branch</li> <li>Real-time streaming telemetry with AI-driven insights from CloudVision</li> <li>Orders of magnitude fewer bugs and security vulnerabilities than any competitor</li> <li>Industry-leading customer satisfaction and a Net Promoter Score of +87</li> </ul> <p>For more information on how Arista can help modernize your network, contact Jeramiah Pauly at jpauly@arista.com</p>"},{"location":"August2025/#feel-free-to-reach-out-to-us-for-your-network-needs","title":"Feel Free to Reach Out To Us For Your Network Needs","text":"<p>We thank you for taking the time to read our newsletter today.
